  "formal_statement": "For a learning algorithm, the expected prediction error on new data can be decomposed as: Error = Bias\u00b2 + Variance + Irreducible Error. Reducing bias typically increases variance and vice versa, for fixed data and model class.",
  "plain_language": "There is a fundamental tradeoff in prediction: simpler models underfit (high bias), complex models overfit (high variance). You cannot minimize both simultaneously without additional resources.",

  "evidence_basis": "Fundamental decomposition proven in statistical learning theory (Geman et al. 1992, Kohavi & Wolpert 1996). The bias-variance decomposition applies universally to squared loss and demonstrates the inherent tradeoff in model complexity selection.",
