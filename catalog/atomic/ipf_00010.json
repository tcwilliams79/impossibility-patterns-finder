  "formal_statement": "For a communication channel with bandwidth B and signal-to-noise ratio SNR, the maximum reliable data rate (channel capacity) is: C = B log₂(1 + SNR) bits per second. Arbitrarily low error rates are achievable at rates below capacity; rates above capacity have irreducible error.",
