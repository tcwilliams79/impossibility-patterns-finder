  "formal_statement": "In a system of n autonomous agents where at least one may act strategically or maliciously, no protocol simultaneously guarantees: (1) consensus on a unique outcome for all honest agents; (2) individual rationality (no agent benefits from unilateral deviation); (3) elimination of all trusted third parties; and (4) tolerance of f>n/3 Byzantine failures—absent additional constraints on agent behavior, problem structure, or resource expenditure.",
