Impossibility Patterns Finder (IPF) — Licensing (v1.0)
Copyright (c) 2025 Thomas C. Williams

This repository uses a SINGLE LICENSE FILE with TWO SECTIONS:

- Section A — SCHEMA & TOOLS (software): MIT License
- Section B — CATALOG & DOCUMENTATION (content): Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC BY 4.0)

This split matches common practice: programmatic artifacts (schemas, validators, scripts)
use a permissive software license to maximize reuse in codebases, while text/metadata
catalog entries and docs use CC BY 4.0 to ensure proper attribution of scholarly content.
